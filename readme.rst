Messager
###################

Messager is a simple micro-blogging site built using CodeIgniter, covering some of the basic functionality offered by
Twitter. It includes functionality allowing users to:

-  login
-  post messages
-  view other users' messages
-  follow other users
-  view a combined feed of messages posted by everybody they follow
-  search messages

I have included a copy of the initial database in the root directory (containing users and a few messages). If you would like to run the project, database can be set up by editing the database.php file in /application/config/.
